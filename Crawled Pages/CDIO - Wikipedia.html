The CDIO Initiative is an educational framework stressing engineering fundamentals set in the context of conceiving, designing, implementing and operating real-world systems and products. Throughout the world, CDIO Initiative collaborators have adopted CDIO as the framework of their curricular planning and outcome-based assessment. CDIO is a trademarked initialism for Conceive Design Implement Operate.

Concept[edit]
The CDIO concept was originally conceived at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the late 1990s.[1] In 2000, MIT in collaboration with three Swedish universities - Chalmers University of Technology, Linköping University and the Royal Institute of Technology — formally founded the CDIO Initiative.[2] It became an international collaboration, with universities around the world adopting the same framework.[3]
CDIO collaborators recognize that an engineering education is acquired over a long period and in a variety of institutions, and that educators in all parts of this spectrum can learn from practice elsewhere. The CDIO network therefore welcomes members in a diverse range of institutions ranging from research-led internationally acclaimed universities to local colleges dedicated to providing students with their initial grounding in engineering.
The collaborators maintain a dialogue about what works and what does not and continue to refine the project. Determining additional members of the collaboration is a selective process managed by a Council comprising original members and early adopters.[4]
The CDIO revised syllabus consists of four parts:[5][6]

Disciplinary knowledge and reasoning
Personal and professional skills and attributes
Interpersonal skills: teamwork and communication
Conceiving, designing, implementing, and operating systems in the enterprise, societal, and environmental context
